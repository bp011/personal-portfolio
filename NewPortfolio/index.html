      <h2>Project: ColoChat</h2>
      <p> ColoChat is an interactive web-app that is designed to bring awareness and understanding to Aboriginal languages
        and culture in a new medium. ColoChat is created to be fun and interactive and to provide a more memorable alternative
        to in-class lessons for school children from grades 5-9. In the absence of the availability of an Aboriginal language
        teacher, Colo is readily available to provide translations and quizzes Aboriginal language.The purpose of ColoChat
        is to spark an interest in students and motivate them to further explore the topic.
        <br>
        <br> My role in the project was project coordinator and design-lead. This involved designing the general site functionality
        and interactions, then translating these into static mock-ups using Adobe Illustrator and implementing these through
        CSS. I also designed and created our chatbot character, Colo.

      <h3>Part A - Developing the Initial Concept</h3>
      <h4>Product Requirements</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Implement an engaging web-application.</li>
        <li>Present one or more datasets from
          <a href="https://data.gov.au/organization/slq?page=1">
            State Library of Queensland (SLQ)
          </a>
          in an interactive manner.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h4>My Contribution</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Created the intial idea of using a language data set to form a chatbot.</li>
        <li>Researched current Aboriginal language learning and revival platforms.</li>
        <li>Lead team activities for brainstorming the main functionality of ColoChat.</li>
        <li>Designed the user interfaces (UI) including layout, colours and imagery.</li>
        <li>Designed Colo, our chatbot character.</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Reflection</h4>
      <p>Part A was very successful as we made a strong start on the project. Having a detailed design direction and plans
        for development gave us a clear direction for Part B. Our approach to split the work required based on a task breakdown
        I had created was very effective. My main concern is that none of us knew all of the research to an in-depth level
        which may have restricted our understanding later on. Based on tutor feedback, to improve on Part A we could have
        concised the research and better separated the features and interactivity. These points were lated improved upon
        in the final design report in Part C. In terms of team work we needed to devise a better strategy for completing
        the report, as the work load was not completed equally due to underestimating the time required for editing, compiling
        and formatting.</p>
      <div id="infoA" class="hidden">
        <h4>Ideation</h4>
        <p>
          Producing an Aboriginal language chatbot was our intial idea. However, to ensure we were considering a range of areas in
          the design space, based on my experience tutoring DECO1100, I suggested to the team to brainstorm using concept
          cards. In the end, we chose the chatbot as it was the idea we were most enthusiastic towards, however, using our
          other ideas we were able to improve upon the concept. My work in this stage involved completing background research
          on Aboriginal language revival and designing the user experience, layout and interactivity of the web application.
        </p>
        <h4>Research</h4>
        <p>
          My research focused on evaluating the existing Aboriginal language-learning platforms and understanding the challenges of
          teaching these languages. Currently, the main platforms are university courses, online videos and language centres,
          an evaluation of each can be viewed below.

            </td>
          </tr>
        </table>
        <p>
          The most prominent challenge is the lack of human-resources e.g. teaches and translators, which has made it difficult for
          the current platforms to provide a personalised, flexible, and time and cost-efficient option. This influenced
          our ideation processes as we wanted to make a more accessible language-learning experience.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          To assist with developing our concept, myself and another teammate met with <a href="https://languages-cultures.uq.edu.au/profile/1004/greg-dickson">Professor
            Greg Dickson</a>, a specialist in Aboriginal languages, Indigenous languages, Bilingual education, Endangered
          languages. Originally, we had assumed we could be a language-learning platform like Duolingo but for the Aboriginal
          languages provided by the SLQ data. However, after talking to Dr Dickson, we arrived at the realisation that not
          only was this out of scope, but there is also hesitation towards trying to solve cultural problems with technology.
          Therefore, we decided it would be more effective to have ColoChat bring awareness to students and spark interest
          in Aboriginal Languages, and then direct them to more robust platforms such as local language centres.
        </p>
        <h4>Initial User Interface Designs</h4>
        <img class="round-box image_mid" src="IMG/orig_0.png" alt="Sketch of chatbot page">
        <p>
          My preliminary designs were sketches illustrating the main functionality. The main chat page remained almost unchanged up
          until the final design. This was because the design was heavily inspired by popular messenger boxes on sites such
          as Facebook and WeChat. The initial home page was not used in the final design due to its lack of engagement and
          interactivity.
        </p>
        <img class="round-box image_mid" src="IMG/orig_2.png" alt="Sketch of chatbot page">
        <p>
          In this design, a major change in site direction was using the koala as the face of our chatbot. The main problem with this
          design is that the colours are not bright and colourful like often seen in children’s’ sites. This is because we
          tried to take inspiration from Aboriginal art which has more Earthy colours, however, it was decided that engaging
          the users was a higher priority.
        </p>
        <img class="round-box image_mid" src="IMG/mid_2.png" alt="Sketch of chatbot page">
        <p>
          This was the final static design created before development started. Not only has our chatbot character, Colo, been redesigned,
          but the colour scheme has shifted towards a brighter pink.
        </p>
        <h4>Initial Chatbot Character Sketches</h4>
        <div id="evolution-colo" class="progress_images flex-center-row">
          <img class="round-box" src="IMG/colo_1.png" alt="Sketch of Colo">

        </div>
        <ol>
          <li>This was just a placeholder image that inspired the rest of our designs. The cute and simple design worked
            well for a kids site. The koala also tied in well to the site theme.</li>
          <li>Brainstorm of potential character designs. The second design was chosen as it was cute and interesting. It
            also has a futuristic design which suits the chatbot.</li>
          <li>Sketches of different expressions for Colo. These are seen in the final designs.</li>
        </ol>
        <h4>Colo's Final Design</h4>
        <img class="image_full" src="IMG/colo_final.jpg" alt=" Three Colos with different expressions">
        <p>Colo is designed to be friendly, recogniseable and resemble both a koala and a robot. I created Colo's final design
          using Illustrator. Three different expression were developed to create variety. More expressions can be easily
          developed by swapping out the expression layers.</p>

      <h3>Part B - Creating the Minimum Viable Product (MVP)</h3>
      <h4>MVP Description</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>The visual layout of ColoChat had been nearly fully implemented. The CHAT page and the HELP page have content,
          while the INFO page had not yet been completed. At this stage, the pages were only responsive for standard desktop
          displays and did not have tablet or mobile-friendly versions.</li>
        <li>The key interaction was completed, with Colo being able to respond to standard conversational messages, complete
          translations in the 18 different Aboriginal languages, and give short-quizzes.</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>My Contribution</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Designed static mock-ups of each page to be used as a reference during development.</li>
        <li>Was the main contributor towards writing the HELP page instructions.</li>
        <li>Styled the Vue.js components using SCSS to match the mock-ups.</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Reflection</h4>
      <p>User-testing showed that Part B was also very successful. At this stage we had completed a substantial MVP compared
        to most teams which included all of our main features working. This meant we were able to use Part C to refine the
        MVP into a completed product. The main improvment needing ot be made to the product were adding mobile compatibility,
        fixing bugs in the chatbot dialogue, refining the usability and understandibility and implementing advanced features.
        The main process recommendations were in regard to group management and include ensuring everyone is contributing
        equally. The extent of this issue became very apparent in Part B and unfortunately was not fixed in later stages.
        The handling of this issue could have been improved by talking to the course coordinator earlier on.</p>
      <div id="infoB" class="hidden">
        <h4>Static Mock-ups</h4>
        <p>
          To assist the rest of team with visualising the entire website, I created static mock-ups for all three of the main pages
          in Adobe Illustrator.
        </p>
        <h4>Implementing style through SCSS</h4>
        <p>
          After the team’s developer created the Vue.js components, I was able to style the components using SCSS. The components were
          styled as closely as possible to the static mock-ups, with very little design changes between Part A and B.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>A visual comparison of the mock-ups vs the visual design at the end of Part B can be seen below.</p>

      <h3>Part C - Final Product</h3>
      <h4>Deliverables</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Completed web application.</li>
        <li><a href="FILE/COLOCHAT_DESIGN_REPORT_2018.pdf" download="">Design Report</a></li>
        <li>Trade Show display and presentation.</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>My Contribution</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Adding mobile device compatibility.</li>
        <li>Refining the styling and UI.</li>
        <li>Creating ColoChat posters and marketing material, i.e. info booklets and sticker designs.</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Trade Show Result</h4>
      <div class="progress_images flex-center-row">
        <img class="image_full" src="IMG/tradeshow0.jpg" alt="Users testing ColoChat at trade show">
        <img class="image_full" src="IMG/team.jpg" alt="Team photo">
      </div>
      <p>
        During the tradeshow, users had a very positive experience trying our product (likely because of the loolies and free stickers).
        Many users were enticed by the visually appealing and friendly design of ColoChat and mentioned they liked Colo's
        cute and noticeable design. Our team also worked hard to invite users walking past and to assist users who had questions
        or problems to ensure each user's entire experience.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        There were a number of positive yet unexpected user interactions. For example, originally, we had envisioned Colo to be used
        individually, yet many users tested ColoChat in pairs and had a lot of fun chatting and laughing with Colo. There
        was also no one observed who skipped the intro, showing how it was a valuable feature for first time users. Furthermore,
        some feedback we got from users was, “how is Colo so intuitive with the responses?”, “what API are you using?”. This
        illustrated how the decision to use the Google API (DialogFlow) enabled us to bring Colo alive and give it a personality
        of its own.
      </p>
      <h4>Reflection</h4>
      <p>Overall, ColoChat was very successful, and this was reflected by the number of people who enjoyed using our site
        at the trade show which led to us winning the People’s Choice Award. There are no major changes that would be made
        to the final product, however, there are a number of features which could be added in future iterations including
        speech-to-text support. In terms of the process taken in Part C, the work flow was effectively divided and problems
        were resolved in a very time-efficient manner. We did encounter problems with one of the APIs we were using, DialogFlow,
        however, this was an external problem that meant we could only wait after contacting the support team. An improvement
        to the process taken in Part C could have been to have team members work on additional features outside of their
        general responsibilities. This was completed to some extent but could be furthered if the project is continued.
      </p>
      <div id="infoC" class="hidden">
        <h4>Overall UI choices</h4>
        <p>
          ColoChat's UI is designed to be fun, inviting and memorable. From the moment you enter the site you meet Colo and undergo
          a short, interactive introduction to Colo's features. We've focused on creating a personal experience which is
          dynamic and different eveytime you use the site. The colours are bright to be eye-catching and keep the user engaged,
          and the content is simple and easy to understand.
        </p>
        <h4>Feedback on UI and Interactivity</h4>
        <p>
          Multiple feedback sessions were held to gain insight into the intuitiveness of the design and to identify problems and bugs.
          These sessions were run by asking a user (all test users were university IT students) to interact with the site
          with limited explanation and without prompts. This feedback is discussed in the Final Design Report.
        </p>
        <h4>Additon of Introductory Sequence</h4>
        <p>
          To guide users on how to interact with Colo, an introductory sequence with an optional walkthrough was added. This walkthrough
          was storyboarded by me, and then implemented by two other team members. Feedback showed this was very effective
          in helping users to better understand and navigate through the site.

        <h3>Expectations & Recommendations</h3>
        <p class="quote">‘I expect this course to be a cross of web development and design thinking, so in other words we'll
          be making a website that is meaningful and usable.’ - My first journal entry</p>
        <p>
          To produce a meaningful website, the designers should have a deep understanding of their users and complete sufficient user-testing
          to ensure usability issues are identified and removed. From my experience testing other teams’ websites, many sites
          were confusing to use and did not have a clearly communicated purpose or context.<br><br><b>Below I have
            listed a few factors which I believe contributed to this issue.</b>
        </p>
        <ul>

            The course did not encourage and inspire students to explore beyond requirements for the reports. Like my own group, I assume
            that in Part A most groups only completed surface-level research and did not thoroughly understand the habits
            and motivations of the target users but merely looked for similar sites for inspirations and made baseless assumptions.
            For example, as the designer I assumed that bright colours would engage children, however, I could have done
            further research to look at the psychology behind different colours and their effect on children. A recommendation
            is to incorporate the exploration of more complex research and design reasoning as a higher-level objective in
            Part A. It would not only result in a stronger basis for Parts B and C, but would also encourage high-achieving
            students to go beyond first-year level expectations.
            <br><br>Furthermore, the course did not scale well to students with prior website experience who wanted to go
            beyond expectations. Incorporating technologies was not easily accepted by the course coordinator, for example
            when we used an external host and NPM. If this had not been accepted it would have limited the success of our
            project. Thankfully, however, we were able to use it.

            The large assessment focus prompted teams to use a ‘divide and conquer’ approach. Although this models a realistic approach
            to completing a team design project, this meant each team member likely only experienced roughly a quarter of
            the design process. It also meant learning was based on the expected report structure and not on team-directed
            exploration of a personalised design space. A recommendation is to hold an activity where each team member must
            present orally to the team their research or to include more individual assessment.
          </li>
          <li>
            My general observation was that teams were generally unwilling to initiate user-testing and didn’t actively seek feedback
            from peers. During contact session, very few times did I observe teams asking other students for feedback unless
            it was an activity directed by the tutors. Even during the paper-prototyping and demo-testing interactions were
            still limited, with many teams not having developed sufficient ways of gaining and recording feedback. I believe
            this was due to the generally low level of ambitiousness from teams. Throughout the entire design and development
            stages of ColoChat, my team constantly asked for feedback and looked for users to test our prototypes. This was
            an essential factor to our success as it helped us to eliminate bugs, particularly with the chatbot.

          <p class="quote">‘That I will learn a lot about personal and team management skills.’ - My first journal entry</p>
          <p>My team had major issues with a team member not contributing equally in the project. Despite the rest of the
            team’s efforts to fix this problem, in the end it wasn’t fixed but instead compensated for. Despite our success
            at the tradeshow, this was the unfortunate reality and the course itself did very little to assist us. Although
            tutors were willing to discuss the issues and in the final weeks we had a team meeting with the course coordinator,
            in the end it was up to us to push for PAF scaling and we chose not to even though I believe in all fairness
            we should have.<br><br>The pressure to condemn a team member’s poor performance shouldn’t be placed on teams
            in a first-year course. Instead, appropriate measures such as regular peer performance evaluations should have
            been in place to formally identify the problem. A recommendation is to use regular formative PAF rounds to identify
            teams earlier on which require further intervention from course staff.</p>

        <h3>Learning Experience</h3>
        <p>Although I didn't learn much from the course activities, I did learn a lot by incorporating new technology into
          ColoChat's implementation and design. Previously, my experience with Adobe Illustrator was limited to illustrations
          and basic logos. After designing Colo, the static mock-ups and the poster, my skill-level with Illustrator has
          greatly improved. Similarly, before this project I had not used Vue.js and SCSS. Incorporating this into the project
          challenged me to learn new frameworks and tools which I can now apply to future projects.
          <br><br> Regarding my learning experience from course activities, I was considerably unimpressed with the course
          for a number of reasons.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Many of the contact activities felt insubstantial. Starting with a ridiculous ice-breaker set a very poor tone for the course
            in my opinion, as it implied the course wasn't taking the students seriously. The following activities were more
            relevant, however, relied on student engagement which was generally low unless participation was anonymous. With
            little to gain in terms of content as we were all drowning in reocurring generic ideas, and no way to remember
            the people we had met, I don't see much value in the activities until groups were formed. For this reason, I
            think we should have been allocated teams as soon as possible.
          </li>
          <li>
            Gaving to saty for the entire workshop timeslot felt unnecessary. Personally, I felt that workshop content was split into
            two categories, (1) Introductory activities that only took part of the workshop to complete, and (2) Activities
            with little relevance to ColoChat. In saying this, it is understandable that the participation marks were put
            in place to ensure all students had adequate fundamental knowledge.

        <h3>Recommendations</h3>
        <p>A summary of my recommendations can be seen below:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Allow for more flexibility in regard to the technologies incorporated, e.g. external hosting, frameworks, etc.</li>
          <li>Give examples of professional sites with good UI and interactivity to heighten self-expectations.</li>
          <li>Provide resources for the UI, e.g. Google's material design and Dribble. Observations showed that many first-years
            were looking for good design examples but had not heard of popular resources.</li>
          <li>Incorporate more individual work into Part A.</li>
          <li>Add a criteria that recognises advanced or creative research and insight.</li>
          <li>Use a better ice-breaker that's relevant to web development.</li>
          <li>Form teams quicker.</li>
          <li>Use regular formative PAF rounds to identify groups with group problems.</li>
          <li>Encourage teams to actively intiate user-testing.</li>

      <p>This portfolio is designed to demonstrate the evolution of ColoChat and detail my contribution to the project.<br><br>It
        was created using HTML, CSS and JavaScript and designed solely by me. I believe this portfolio successfully demonstrates
        my contribution and design process throughout the entire course, and I am very happy with the site aesthetic. The
        site design was inspired by the retro rainbow pattern featured at the front and uses a number of elements from my
        complete portfolio. The content is based off my weekly journal entries using Padlet where I documented the project
        ptrogress and my individual contributions and reflections. Padlet was an extremely useful tool which helped me to
        keep track of my progress using text and images in an easy to read layout. I look forward to using it in future projects.
        <br><br>Future improvements to my portfolio include making it mobile friendly and increasing the accessibility. Overall,
        I learnt a lot from completing ColoChat and creating this portfolio has provided me the chance to reflect on this.<br><br>If
